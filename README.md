The Distance Calculator v3.2
----------------------------
----------------------------

The Distance Calculator is a python application which will help you find the approximate distance between two locations. It uses the Google maps APi for this. Where a direct land route is not available, this
application will still provide an approximation of the as-the-crow-flies, or raw, distance between the two locations entered.
